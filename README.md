# Sleep-disorder
personal devolpment module assignment
Sleep plays a crucial role in health and well-being and explaining variations in sleep quality due to different lifestyle factors could greatly enhance public health. This little project is to explore a lifestyle/sleep study data set with pandas and apply some machine learning on it using Python. The implementation will serve as more so a practical demonstration of the technical codes as well as a practical application of the methodology in data science and machine learning (Mental Health Foundation, n.d.).
